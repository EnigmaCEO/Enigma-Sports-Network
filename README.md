# Enigma Sports Network (ESN)

**A modular AI-powered sports media and analytics network for next-generation games.**

Enigma Sports Network (ESN) is a broadcast-style infrastructure layer that transforms raw game data into professional sports coverage — including automated recaps, highlight imagery, and podcast-style commentary — without requiring live commentators or production teams.

ESN is designed for **sports games, esports titles, and simulated leagues** that want real media gravity, persistent narratives, and shareable moments from day one.

## What ESN Does

ESN converts structured game events into **full broadcast artifacts**:

- **AI Video Highlight Generation (VEO)**
  For the **Game of the Day**, ESN automatically generates an **8-second cinematic highlight video** using **Google’s VEO video generation model**.

- 📰 **Journalistic Game Recap Articles**  
  AI-generated, network-grade written recaps with named players, key moments, and professional tone.

- 🎙 **Podcast Recaps (“Final Verdict”)**  
  Multi-voice, role-aware commentary (Host, Analyst, Color) generated from game data and rendered to audio.

- 🖼 **Highlight Hero Images**  
  Automatically generated article images representing decisive moments of each game.

- 📊 **Coverage Hub UI**  
  A sports-network-style frontend featuring:
  - Game of the Day
  - Hourly Highlights
  - Recent Coverage
  - Event timelines and animated score tickers

All content is produced from **real-time game events** and stored for replay, sharing, and archival — similar to a real sports network.

## Why ESN Exists

Most sports games suffer from:
- Weak or repetitive post-game content
- No meaningful media layer
- No way for players or fans to relive moments
- No broadcast identity

ESN solves this by acting as a **media brain** for sports games:

- Every game becomes content  
- Every match leaves a narrative trail  
- Every league feels legitimate  

This is not commentary for one game.  
This is **infrastructure for entire ecosystems**.

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Pipeline

1. **Game Event Ingestion**
   - Structured JSON from games (scores, drives, plays, turnovers)

2. **AI Content Generation (Serverless)**
   - Article generation (LLM)
   - Podcast script generation
   - Highlight selection logic

3. **Media Rendering**
   - Video generation via Google VEO
   - Audio synthesis via ElevenLabs
   - Image generation via OpenAI
   - Assets stored in object storage (AWS S3)

4. **Distribution Layer**
   - ESN web UI
   - Shareable article and podcast links
   - Future: social embeds, feeds, syndication

All components are modular and replaceable.
